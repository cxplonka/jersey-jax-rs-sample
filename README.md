# JERSEY-JAX-RS-SAMPLE

An example project for an JAX-RS implementation based on [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) and build by [Gradle](http://gradle.org/).
The jersey-test-enviroment is running on an [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) webserver with an servlet engine. It also used the JAXB 
binding for Jersey for XML and JSON provided by [Jackson](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome).
